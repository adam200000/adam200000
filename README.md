- 👋 Hi, I’m @adam200000
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to create a non-euclidian physics engine (just to get the basics of programming down).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and object oriented programming in general (started with C and Assmebly).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for now as I need to improve my skills at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me: generally through my email, which is adam200000@web.de
